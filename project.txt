Hi Welcome to Git Hub Tutorial 

Learn How to use Git and Git hub for DevOps.

This file is written by me . 

Some basic command of Git are --

git init - to intialize the git .

git add - just to add chnages -- git add . / git add file name 

git status - to check status of Git .

git commit -m " message"-- to commit the change means to take a picture of changes .

git log --- just to check the history of all changes. 

git restore --staged file name --- // to remove the previous add without commit . 
git reset -- git reset command is used to resotre the file if it is deleted by mistake.
